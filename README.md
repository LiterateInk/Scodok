## Documentation

You can find documentation with guides at [docs.literate.ink/scodok](https://docs.literate.ink/scodok).

If it's not enough you can also take a look at the [`examples`](https://github.com/LiterateInk/Scodok/tree/main/examples) folder in the GitHub repository for inspiration.

If none of those are helpful, you can always [open an issue](https://github.com/LiterateInk/Scodok/issues) to ask for help or join the [LiterateInk Discord server](https://literate.ink/discord).
